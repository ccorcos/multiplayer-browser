## Better Browser

check this out https://github.com/minbrowser/min

```bash
# Three terminal windows:
npm start # start one app
npm start # start two apps
npm run watch # lets you refresh to update
```

## To do

- why can't I navigate anywhere else?
- sync typing
- sync navigation
- cursors should live in the renderer instead of the website
- clicking altKey and shiftKey.
